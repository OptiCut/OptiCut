# Project Design Theme
The OptiCut product serves as a cutting-edge plugin for AutoCAD, revolutionizing the wood cutting process through optimization. The product's logo draws inspiration from the rich texture of wood, seamlessly intertwined with a symbol representing a saw blade.

## Concept Sketch
Presented here are early sketches showcasing potential designs for the OptiCut logo. The focal point of these concepts revolves around the incorporation of wood texture, where the letter "O" and the saw blade symbol are dynamically intersected diagonally to evoke a sense of motion in the logo. The initial representations are in black and white, with a color version anticipated to be unveiled in the coming days as part of the evolving concept refinement.
